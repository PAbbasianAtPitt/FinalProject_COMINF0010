**Abstract:**

The aim of this project is to determine the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. I thought that a tourism company asked me which area of the city has enough restaurants with a large number of seats to cater to tourists. With the help of our datasets, we are able to conclude that the best neighborhood is Pittsburgh 102 (Wherever that is).
