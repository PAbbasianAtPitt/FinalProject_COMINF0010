Databases used:
Public Art in Pittsburgh Dataset:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-public-art/resource/00d74e83-8a23-486e-841b-286e1332a151
This dataset holds information about all of the different pieces of public art in the city of Pittsburgh; this dataset has various categories such as piece name, artist, location, and even a set of coordinates for the art. However, only the neighborhood metric will be used for our analysis.
Population Dataset:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/82f29015-6905-4b1c-8300-afe9bb2231b3
This dataset describes the population of each neighborhood and a margin of error as well. For our project we will be using the neighborhood and estimated population metrics.



Abstract:
For our determination of the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh we went with a cultural metric using the amount of restaurants and pieces of public art in each neighborhood. To account for differing populations we took art per capita as well. When comparing our data our group concluded that Allegheny Center is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
