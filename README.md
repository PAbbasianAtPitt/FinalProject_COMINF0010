Public Art in Pittsburgh Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-public-art/resource/00d74e83-8a23-486e-841b-286e1332a151 This dataset holds information about all of the different pieces of public art in the city of Pittsburgh; this dataset has various categories such as piece name, artist, location, and even a set of coordinates for the art. However, only the neighborhood metric will be used for our analysis.

Population Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/82f29015-6905-4b1c-8300-afe9bb2231b3 This dataset describes the population of each neighborhood and a margin of error as well. For our project we will be using the neighborhood and estimated population metrics.

Number of parking meters: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parking-meters-pittsburgh-parking-authority

**Abstract:**
 For our determination of the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh we went with a cultural metric using the amount of restaurants, pieces of public art in each neighborhood, and tourism through the amount of parking meters. To account for differing populations we took art per capita as well. Peyman thought about tourism, finding which area of the city has enough restaurants with a large number of seats to cater to tourists. When comparing our data our group concluded that Allegheny Center is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
