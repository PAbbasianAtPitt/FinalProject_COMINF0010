# FinalProject_COMINF0010
My project
To prepare this project, 
I thought that a tourism company asked me which area of the city has enough restaurants with a large number of seats to cater to tourists.
With the help of statistics and data, I was able to say that the best area is Pittsburgh 102 (I do not where is it).
